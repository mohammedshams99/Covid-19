                                            People in the U.S. may be worried or anxious about friends and relatives who

                                            living in or visiting areas where COVID-19 is spreading. Some people are
                                            worried
                                            about the disease. Fear and anxiety can lead to social stigma, for example,
                                            towards Chinese or other Asian Americans or people who were in quarantine.

                                            Stigma is discrimination against an identifiable group of people, a place,
                                            or a
                                            nation. Stigma is associated with a lack of knowledge about how COVID-19
                                            spreads, a need to blame someone, fears about disease and death, and gossip

                                            spreads rumors and myths.<br><br>
        
                                            Stigma hurts everyone by creating more fear or anger towards ordinary people
                                            instead of the disease that is causing the problem.<br>

                                            Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. Some cause illness in people,
                                            and
                                            others, such as canine and feline coronaviruses, only infect animals.

                                            animal coronaviruses that infect animals have emerged to infect people and

                                            spread between people. This is suspected to have occurred for the virus that
                                            causes COVID-19. Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute

                                            Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread from person-to-person

                                            respiratory droplets. Currently there is no evidence to support transmission

                                            COVID-19 associated with food. Before preparing or eating food it is
                                            important
                                            to always wash your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds for general
                                            food
                                            safety. Throughout the day wash your hands after blowing your nose, coughing

                                            sneezing, or going to the bathroom. <br><br>
        
                                            It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or
                                            object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or
                                            possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus
                                            spreads.<br><br>
        
                                            In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on
                                            surfaces,
                                            there is likely very low risk of spread from food products or packaging that
                                            are
                                            shipped over a period of days or weeks at ambient, refrigerated, or frozen

                                            Monitor the patient’s symptoms. If the patient is getting sicker, call his

                                            her healthcare provider and tell them that the patient has

                                            Make sure that shared spaces in the home have good air flow, such as by an

                                            conditioner or an opened window, weather permitting.<br><br>
        
        
                                            Perform hand hygiene frequently. Wash your hands often with soap and water

                                            at least 20 seconds or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains 60

                                            95% alcohol, covering all surfaces of your hands and rubbing them together
                                            until
                                            they feel dry. Soap and water should be used preferentially if hands are

                                            dirty.<br><br>
        
        
                                            Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.<br><br>
        
        
                                            The patient should wear a facemask when you are around other people. If the

                                            same
                                            room as the patient.<br><br>
        
        
                                            Wear a disposable facemask and gloves when you touch or have contact with
                                            the
                                            patient’s blood, stool, or body fluids, such as saliva, sputum, nasal mucus,
                                            vomit, urine.<br><br>
        
                                            Throw out disposable facemasks and gloves after using them. Do not
                                            reuse.<br><br>
        
        
                                            When removing personal protective equipment, first remove and dispose of
                                            gloves.
                                            Then, immediately clean your hands with soap and water or alcohol-based hand
                                            sanitizer. Next, remove and dispose of facemask, and immediately clean your
                                            hands again with soap and water or alcohol-based hand sanitizer.<br><br>
        
        
                                            Avoid sharing household items with the patient. You should not share dishes,
                                            drinking glasses, cups, eating utensils, towels, bedding, or other items.
                                            After
                                            the patient uses these items, you should wash them thoroughly (see below

                                            Clean all “high-touch” surfaces, such as counters, tabletops, doorknobs,
                                            bathroom fixtures, toilets, phones, keyboards, tablets, and bedside tables,
                                            every day. Also, clean any surfaces that may have blood, stool, or body

                                            Use a household cleaning spray or wipe, according to the label instructions.
                                            Labels contain instructions for safe and effective use of the cleaning

                                            The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough.
                                            Some
                                            patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat

                                            diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people
                                            become infected but don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most
                                            people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special
                                            treatment.

                                            Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread from person-to-person

                                            respiratory droplets. Currently there is no evidence to support transmission

                                            important
                                            to always wash your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds for general
                                            food

                                            It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or
                                            object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or
                                            possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus

                                            there is likely very low risk of spread from food products or packaging that
                                            are
